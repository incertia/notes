\section{Square Matrices}
\subsection{Linear Things}
Square matrices are very special, so they get their own section.

\begin{df}
The identity transformation has a corresponding identity matrix $I_n$
where the $ii$-th entries are $1$ and the other entries are $0$.
\end{df}

\begin{df}
We define the \textbf{trace} of a square matrix $A$, denoted $\Tr(A)$,
to be the sum of the elements along the main diagonal of $M$, or,
equivalently, $\sum A_{ii}$.
\end{df}

\begin{prop}
The trace of a matrix is the unique linear transformation $T :
\mathcal{M}(n, n) \rightarrow F$ satisfying:
\begin{itemize}
\item $T(I_n) = n$
\item $T(AB) = T(BA)$
\end{itemize}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
% TODO: finish proof
Suppose $f$ is another mapping that satisfies the above properties.
\end{proof}

\subsection{MULTIlinear???!}
Yeah multilinearity is a thing.

\begin{df}
A function $f : V_1 \times \cdots \times V_n$ is $n$-linear if $f$ is
linear in each argument, or $F(v_k) = f(c_1, c_2, \dots, c_{k - 1}, v_k,
c_{k + 1}, \dots, c_n)$ is linear for each $k$.
\end{df}
