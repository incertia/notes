# Lecture Notes
Welcome to my compilation of lecture notes for whatever classes I happen
to be taking at the time.

## Math 416: Abstract Linear Algebra
This collection of notes is a mix between the very abstract stuff I
found in Evan Chen's
[notes](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/PgKMScSDrHVh5b1EWKe8qv77pZtX5tnpAmSSHETRylkHmWSYrAUtAq3b8Wxv5QgT?dl=1)
and the somewhat less abstract things I am curently doing at UIUC.
Trying to understand the connection between these two sets of notes is
likely to improve my understanding of linear algebra, which is why I am
doing this.

## Math 424: Honors Real Analysis
Notes arranged in a day by day format until I consolidate everything at
the end of the class

## Math 427: Honors Abstract Algebra
Notes arranged in a day by day format until I consolidate everything at
the end of the class
